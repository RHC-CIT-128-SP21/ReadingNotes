# trees
* tree is a hierarchal form of data structure
* root node is the original node of which all nodes come from
* sub-tree is a tree with bides being a descendant of some other tree
* degree relates to number of sub-trees given to a node
* leaf node is a node with a degree of 0
* edge is connection between two nodes
* parent is nodes that have sub-trees connecting to it
* child is a node that connects to the parent node
* sibling is nodes that share the same parent node
* level is the number of connections from the root node
* height of tree is numbers of level a tree has
* depth is number of edges from the root of the tree 
* for parent child relationship to exist, there needs to data within the nodes
* binary tree is each node has a maximum of two children
* binary search tree is a binary tree that allows the search of data with efficient manner
* BTS has an insert and remove operation
*  BTS inserts data as nodes
* BTS also has ways when to delete nodes when its no child, one child, or 2 child
* BTS searches for data the same way it does for inserting
* to traverse a tree in preorder mode, one must visit the left sub-tree and then the right
* Reverse Polish Notation places the operator after its operand
* BTS is the best option when it comes tpo data that needs to be searched
* Expression trees are used to parse arithmetic and Boolean expressions
