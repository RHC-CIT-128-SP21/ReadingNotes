# Design Techniques and Strategies
* recursion algorithms calls themselves until conditions are met
* logical is comprised of axioms that are used for computation
* sequential algorithms are executed sequentially and happen without any other execution process
* Deterministic will give the same result every time the algorithm is giving the same input
* Non-deterministic algorithms change the order of execution
* Classification is done by the amount of space it takes and time it takes
* Divide and conquer is when the program divides the problem into smaller problems and solves those smaller problems and brings it back to the final solution to the main problem
* Dynamic programming is similar to divide and conquer b breaking big problem into smaller problems, but it uses optimal substructure and overlapping sub problem
* greedy algorithm is to pick the solution that brings the most benefit and keep doing that until a perfect solution is made
* memorization is when you get the big problem and break it into smaller problems
* tabulation is when you put solutions on a table and combine to solve the big main problem
* divide means to break down the entity or the problem
* Conquer is about solving the smallest problem and working your way up to the main problem
* merge is when you combine all the smaller solutions to solve the big main problem
* merge sort is a list of unsorted elements and through recursion, one can allow the item list to be sorted
* p stands for polynomial which is a step-wise process of logical steps
* NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time which means that it is much harder to solve
* a problem is considered NP-hard if all problems is related to polynomial time reducible
* NP-complete problem is an np-hard and is found within the NP class
