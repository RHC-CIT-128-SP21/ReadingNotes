# Algorithm Design Paradigms
* There are three types of algorithm designs: Divide and conquer, Greedy algorithms, 
and dynamic programming
* divide and conquer: breaking the problem into smaller problems and combining them into one giant solution
* Greedy is when the easiest most direct route is the best course of action
* dynamic is great when the sub problems overlap each other and one great solution can be made

#Recursion and Backtracking
* recursion is great for divide and conquer problems
* recursive functions is one of two types of cases, base cases which tells the recursion is told to be ended and recursive case in which they call the function they are within

# Backtracking
* backtracking is great when you need to return from a tree like structure code
* it is great for handling paths that lead to no results

# Divide and Conquer â€“ Long Multiplication
* when multiplication occurs, the code does take time to process the information. However, recursions allows for a larger numbers to be computed
* asymptotic analysis is when one wants to learn what happens when the input is very large

# Can we do better? A recursive Approach
* Karatsuba algorithm is known for its ability to handle long multiplication
* It takes the numbers and puts them into smaller sets, and the recursive program breaks down the large into smaller numbers
* recursive approach is to multiply two numbers because the procedure involves multiplication
