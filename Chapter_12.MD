# Arrays
* array is similar to lists ecept that the data is limited to a single type of data
* arrays support operations such as indexing, slicing, concatenation, and multiplication
* arrays are much more efficient at storing data
* list take up much more space than arrays do

# List and Pointer Structures
* pointers show the place in memory where a certain file or image Is at
* variables are rather references to pieces of info

# Arrays 
* a sequential list of data, which means that each element is stored after the previous one in memory
* arrays are really fast because they are all in sequential order

# Pointer Structure
* pointer structures are list of items that can be spread out in memory
* linked lists will have links to the next items in the structure
* tile-based game, the node will have links to 6 map cells
* they do not require sequential storage and they start small but grow randomly as you add
 
# Nodes
* node is a container of data that connects to other nodes
* link is a pointer to each node

# Finding endpoints
* when working with nodes, it must be stated that it is the end of the lsit

# Node
* when none is put in a nude, it is used to end the list
* make sure there is a difference between a node and data

# Other Node Types
* some nodes can go interchangeably between one another
* this can be used especially in tile based games to set borders on the map

# Single Linked Lists
* a single linked list is a list with on pointer between two successive nodes
* can only go in one direction
* one can link nodes together as a chain

# Append Operation
* you want little access to the node
* encapsulate the data in the node to then use a pointer
* one can append faster to nodes by having reference to the beginning and ending of the nodes
