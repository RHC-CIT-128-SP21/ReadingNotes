Basic Inheritance
*All classes use a form of inheritance, such as the built in class named object
*Superclass is a class that is being inherited from
*Subclass is set to be derived from a parent class
*Class variables is shared by all instances of classes

Extending Built-ins
*You can add functionality to built-in classes through the process of inheritance
*Syntactic sugar is calling the constructor
*A list is an instance of an object
*Objects, lists, sets, dictionaries, files, and str is what is normally extended

Overriding and super
*Overriding is altering or replacing a method with a new one with the same name within a superclass 
*Any method can be written and not just initialized ones
*Super functions return the object as an instance of the parent class
*A super() call can be made inside any method

Multiple Inheritance
*Multiple inheritance is when a subclass inherits more than one parent class is able to access both functionalities
*Mixin is a superclass that is not supposed to exist on its own, but is meant to provide for subclasses for inheritance
*You can add behavior instead of just having a place to store it

Diamond Problem
*The diamond problem is when the superclass is called multiple times for initialization
*What this means that the code will connect to a database or call the parent object twice

Different Sets of Arguments
*Kwargs, or dictionary is inputted as a parameter so that capture any additional parameters without causing any issues
*Sometimes the kwargs cannot be accessed forthright and one must make sure the values are set

Polymorphism
*It is when different behaviors happen to a subclass depending which is used
*You must inheritance to use polymorphism to its fullest capability
*Reduces the need and use of inheritance if done well

Abstract Base Class	
*Set of methods or properties that classes need to implement to be considered for duck typing
*Most ABC exists in pythonâ€™s standard library
