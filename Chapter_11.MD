# What’s the Big Picture
* everything computer related is actually only 1’s and 0’s
* binary is to describe the state of an object by using the idea of polarized state(on or off, 1 or 0, north or south)
* Everything digital uses these principals to creates bits and these bits is what holds the information that we know and use today

# Getting Started
* braille is a form of binary in which the parts of the symbol are raised or not raised
* data can be stored with even more distinction but it can make the entire system more complicated than it needs to be
* This idea of only two states has offered a lot faster and easy translation

# Numbers
* computers can only store information using bits
* The value of the bits is equal to two times the value to what is right of it
* computers store data as 16, 32, or 64 bits
* a byte is 8 bits and each byte Is the grouping used to separate each set of data
* hexadecimal is a great short hand to binary. The numbers are not directly represented for they represent the binary that reflects the value
* somethings are stored as actual numbers or they will lose their value for example like phone numbers

# Text
* ASCII uses 64 unique patterns to represent different characters
* Every character has its own binary code identifier
* UTF exists to expand the library of characters to different languages such as Chinese

# Image and Colors
* computer screens are made up of 3 colors, red green and blue
* values are given to the pixel as strength in color so it allows for the changes in color
* one can use binary to set the value of the color

# Memory Management in Python
* Python relies a lot on memory efficient code
* with bigger data, memory management is very important
* memory allocation is the most important part of memory management
* Static memory allocation is declaring static arrays with fixed sizes
* Dynamic memory allocation is ran during the run time, meaning that is fluid
* stack memory creates methods and variables
* heap memory creates objects and instance variables
